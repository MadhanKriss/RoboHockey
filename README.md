# RoboHockey - Technoxian 2024  

Welcome to the **RoboHockey** project! ðŸš€  

This repository documents the development of a remote-controlled robot designed for playing RoboHockey in the **Technoxian 2024** competition.  

## Features  
- **Custom Hardware Design**: Built for agility, durability, and precision on the playing field.  
- **Control System**: Logitech F710 game controller paired with Arduino and USB shield for seamless remote operation.  
- **Motor Control**: Powered by the Cytron MDD20A motor driver for efficient and responsive movement.   

## Hardware Components  
- **Arduino Board**: The brain of the robot, handling control signals.  
- **USB Shield**: Enables integration with the Logitech F710 game controller.  
- **Cytron MDD20A Motor Driver**: Drives the robotâ€™s motors for precise and powerful movement.  
- **Logitech F710**: Wireless game controller for real-time navigation and gameplay.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/MadhanKriss/RoboHockey.git  
   ```  
2. Upload the code from the `src/` folder to the Arduino board.  
3. Pair the Logitech F710 controller and test the robot.
